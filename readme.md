# Done
## The place to track your habits
Done is a simple and intuitive habit tracking app build with React Native. You can track daily or weekly habits, with the option to add multiple occurrences per day or week, with a streak that increases daily or weekly if the habit is completed, else the streak goes back to 0. You can also "pause" a habit if you are unable to complete it for a given time period, or you are no longer tracking that habit but want to keep your streak.
